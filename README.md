# ut-tacos-sequelized
My taco eating app (ut-taco), using sequelize.

### Taco Time
This is a taco creator that allows the user to devour the taco afterwards. The app is handled with node and express. Handlebars is used for the templating system to generate HTML and sequelize to interact with SQL.

### How to use Taco Time
One can add a taco by filling out the input form and hitting submit. This will add a taco to the tacos list on the left. If you click devour, ti will eat the taco and move it to the right as disabled.

### How to run the program
you can go to : https://guarded-dusk-66830.herokuapp.com/

or clone the repo `ut-taco-sequelized`, clone the repo, `npm install` all the node dependencies and host it on our own node server. You will need to add the SQL schema to initialize the database.
